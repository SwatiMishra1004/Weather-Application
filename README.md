# Weather-Application

A weather application is a software tool that provides real-time weather information, forecasts, and related data. It pulls data from weather sources or APIs to display conditions like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
Fetches real-time weather data from an API, displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather conditions.

Technologies Used -

HTML: For structuring the app, including an input field for the city search, display containers for weather data, and placeholders for dynamically added content.
CSS: For styling the app interface with a visually pleasing layout. Use Flexbox or Grid for layout, and CSS transitions for hover effects.
JavaScript: For fetching data from a weather API (like OpenWeather API), handling the search functionality, and updating the DOM with the weather information.

Project Structure -

Index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure, including input fields, display sections for weather details, and placeholders for error messages.
Styles.css: A CSS file that defines the design, colors, fonts, and responsive adjustments for different screen sizes.
main.js: A JavaScript file for fetching data from the weather API, processing user input, and dynamically updating the display with current weather information.
